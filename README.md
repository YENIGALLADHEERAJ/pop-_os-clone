Project Goal
The primary goal of this project was to practice core web development skills by creating a static webpage. The design was inspired by the official Pop!_OS website, with a focus on a clear, organized layout and a polished, thematic style.
Process
The development process for this webpage followed a specific workflow:
Analysis and Planning: Before writing any code, I analyzed the Pop!_OS website's layout. I then used a simple tool like MS Word to draw out the main sections, including the top header, main header, various body parts, and the footer. This planning stage helped to visualize the structure and served as a blueprint for the HTML.
HTML Implementation: With the plan in place, I created the popos.html file. I used semantic HTML tags and div elements with descriptive class names to build the page's structure, directly translating the layout from my MS Word document into code.
CSS Styling: The style.css file was used to apply all the visual design elements. I used CSS to control the layout, color scheme, typography, and to add interactive elements like hover effects and button styles. The design choices were made to emulate the clean, vibrant look of the Pop!_OS interface.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the webpage structure and content.
CSS: For all styling, layout, and visual effects.
Features
Clean UI: A simple and organized user interface with clear typography and spacing.
Interactive Elements: Hover effects on buttons and navigation links.
Embedded Video: An embedded YouTube video to showcase a feature of the OS.
